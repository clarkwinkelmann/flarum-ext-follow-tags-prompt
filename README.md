Prompt user for tags to follow after registration.

This is a companion extension that requires [FriendsOfFlarum Tags](https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/follow-tags) to work.

The modal will open for all new or existing users who have not clicked the "Continue" button present in the modal.
If the modal is closed in any other way than the "Continue" button, it will open again on the next page refresh.

The list of tags shown in the modal can be customized.

By default, a button to access the modal is also added to the "Following" page.
This can be disabled in the settings.

The extension also contains two other unrelated features:

- Ability to make the "Following" page display all discussions without filtering for guests instead of showing an empty page.
- Ability to make the "Following" page the homepage (under Basics)

Those options are disabled by default.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-follow-tags-prompt

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.
